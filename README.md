# hackathon

This hackathon project with IMAGINE_BGKY focuses on future plans for an improved infrastructure, focused around a rail/subway system. It utilizes Django, a Python web framework to accomplish this feat with a map that can show the destinations and routes of these potential rail systems. There are also forms that allow for anonymous complaints and a way to obtain passes for this system.
